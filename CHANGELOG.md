# Changelog

## 0.1.63 - 2026-09-26

- Cross-document discovery records one relation label per Memory pair
  (`equivalent`, `updates`, `contradicts`, or nothing) and no longer creates
  Cross-Source Conflict Reviews (ADR 0037). `supersede` is the only Memory Review
  kind; `list_memory_reviews` no longer takes `kind`.
- Search and `get_memory` return `relations` and `relation_notice` in place of
  `conflict_contexts` and `contradiction_warning`. An `equivalent` Memory is
  returned once, and the newer Memory of an `updates` pair ranks directly ahead
  of the older one.
- New MCP tools `dismiss_memory_relation` and `restore_memory_relation`, and
  `get_memory` lists `dismissed_relations` that can be undone. A dismissal
  hides one relation until either Memory changes and changes no Memory. Memory
  detail in the admin UI shows relations with dismiss and undo, and the
  Memories list can show the current relations by the label readers see.
- Maintenance operators can list exhausted relation discovery work and re-run
  exhausted or completed work by error code, time range or classifier version.
- A one-time conversion turns existing Cross-Source Conflict Reviews into
  relations and dismissals (a dismissed Review dismisses both `contradicts` and
  `updates`; decided Reviews can be relabeled by id, as for the evaluation set), re-runs discovery for pending ones, and deletes the converted
  Reviews as a separate step. Decided Reviews can be pinned first as the
  relation evaluation set.
- Relation discovery completes when its Source Unit has a newer revision and the
  Memory's evidence is still current.
- Remove the unused contradiction count and the `/memories/contradictions`
  route.

## 0.1.62 - 2026-09-25

- Retry failed Agent Session capture uploads with exponential backoff from 60
  seconds up to one hour, and reset the backoff after a successful upload.
- Stop sending captures that cannot select a workspace. They wait until the
  session directory resolves to a workspace, either on a later hook or at the
  hourly check; waiting captures whose transcript is older than 7 days are
  dropped and recorded in the queue.
- Show the workspace binding hint at SessionStart while captures wait for a
  workspace and the current project is unbound.
- Add `--workspace-id` to workspace-scoped CLI commands. `search` and `memory`
  commands use the current directory's workspace binding when the option is
  omitted; other commands report the selectable workspace IDs when the account
  has several.
- `memforge adapter auth jira refresh` and `watch` upload one captured session
  to every workspace with a Jira Source for the origin and report each result.
  Only the service's `jira_principal_changed` conflict is reported as a
  principal change.
- `POST /api/v1/agent-sessions/windows` answers a failed model call with a
  retryable 503 (`agent_session_llm_failed`, with `category`, `error_code` and
  `Retry-After`) instead of 400 or 500.

## 0.1.61 - 2026-09-09

- Coalesce Stop, PreCompact, and SessionStart capture requests under one on-demand
  upload owner, with durable fresh-request priority and safe shutdown handoff.
- Bound historical recovery to five sessions per activation and retry failures
  only on later events after a 60-second cooldown.
- Restart both clients after existing workers exit when upgrading from 0.1.60.

## 0.1.60 - 2026-09-08

- Preserve the hook that wakes Agent Session capture while another local worker
  is active. The detached worker waits for the shared queue lock and claims its
  requesting session before unrelated historical backlog.
- Keep the existing bounded claim, lease, bookmark, retry, and server upload
  contracts unchanged.

## 0.1.59 - 2026-09-05

- Publish the Codex and Claude Code plugins with grouped `get_memory.evidence[]`
  provenance. Source links, original-document locators, Evidence excerpts, and
  Artifact locators survive response compaction.
- Upgrade existing plugin installations and reload their MCP connections when
  using a service that returns grouped Evidence. Earlier release tags still
  read the removed flat `sources[]` and `evidence_artifacts[]` fields.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

- Breaking: `get_memory` now exposes provenance only through grouped
  `evidence[]`. The deprecated flat `sources[]` and `evidence_artifacts[]`
  fields have been removed; document and PDF locators live under
  `evidence[].document`, and Artifact locators remain under
  `evidence[].items[].artifact.url`.
- Initial public repository preparation.
- Self-hosted MemForge service with FastAPI admin API, SQLite persistence,
  FTS search, Chroma vector search, and MCP tools.
- React admin UI for memories, entities, sources, review, and settings.
- Codex and Claude Code integration packages with thin hook adapters and
  service-owned agent-session package generation.
- Jira browser-session capture now runs in the client CLI and uploads to the
  server over POST /api/auth/jira-session; the server no longer scrapes a
  browser. New `memforge adapter auth jira watch` keeps the session fresh
  proactively. PAT mode is unchanged.
