# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

- Breaking: `get_memory` now exposes provenance only through grouped
  `evidence[]`. The deprecated flat `sources[]` and `evidence_artifacts[]`
  fields have been removed; document and PDF locators live under
  `evidence[].document`, and Artifact locators remain under
  `evidence[].items[].artifact.url`.
- Initial public repository preparation.
- Self-hosted MemForge service with FastAPI admin API, SQLite persistence,
  FTS search, Chroma vector search, and MCP tools.
- React admin UI for memories, entities, sources, review, and settings.
- Codex and Claude Code integration packages with thin hook adapters and
  service-owned agent-session package generation.
- Jira browser-session capture now runs in the client CLI and uploads to the
  server over POST /api/auth/jira-session; the server no longer scrapes a
  browser. New `memforge adapter auth jira watch` keeps the session fresh
  proactively. PAT mode is unchanged.
