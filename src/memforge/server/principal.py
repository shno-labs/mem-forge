"""Resolve the authenticated principal for an HTTP request.

The principal is the only authoritative source of `AccessScope.user_id`. A
request body may carry a `user_id` HINT, but it is ignored by the resolver:
authority comes from the resolved principal, never from a client-declared
field. In v1 (single-tenant local), the resolver returns LOCAL_DEV_USER_ID.
A future authentication integration is the only thing that changes here.
